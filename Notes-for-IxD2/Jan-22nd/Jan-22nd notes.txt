Sensors with arduino


Fingers send electrical currents through touch screens.


Echolocation sensor, can I please have?


Wearables for biometrics
Sensors also for tsunami prevention
 

int pin7 = 7; inte

digitalread(); only returns a high or a low value i.e. binary 0 or 1



analogread(); reads voltage sensor. Return the value between 0-1023
		returns it in bits 



Variable setup 

int var = 0; sensor info goes here

void loop() {
	var = digitalRead(Pin);
	// prints the line to the console
	println(var);


	

}

map(); allows us to change the number range of an analogRead();

void loop(){

	int x = 0;
	x = analogRead(Pin7); reads pin 7 and adds it to the x value 
	
	map(x,0,1023,0,500); //takes the x vale and divides the default range into 500

}


Pin setup for an output

int PIN6 = 6; //integer

pinMode(Pin6, OUTPUT) // sets pin6 to output the 


Why choose these pins 



Assignment 2


Consider the Aesthetics of the device 
theres a thing called pulse width modulation



analogWrite(); sends value between 0, and 1023 only works with PWM pins

	Servos also only run on PWM pins 


Duty cycle is how many times it outputs the voltage per amount of time. 
	this depends on where "the dial is turned '
	halfway = 50%

You could set this up with an RGB LED in terms of where it is on a dial.
