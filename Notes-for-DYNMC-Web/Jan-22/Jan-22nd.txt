Class names should take usability into consideration

BEM CSS methodology

Block the parent component
Element	the child of the block
Modifier is a variation of the blocks style 


Each one of the child elements take on the name of the parent with two underscores and then its specific element. 

For modifier you use two dashes and but it in the block level after the original block class
