////////////////////Tearing apart Ryan's Bio\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

What works in the bio?

	The subheading 
		leads the person to believe the writing is more interesting
	Dynamic expression of multiple fields
	Shows various strengths and so that people get a gist of what he's about

What Doesn't work?

	Inconsistent format in the list of the degrees
	What exactly did you do when he was in waiter by day, what does it mean?
	Three years out of date
	Keep your bio up to date s that you can update it. 
	We don't really know about him as a person at all. 

	Grammatical errors:
	
		Run-on sentence

	Serious about funny, actually not really funny at all.
	false expectations. 
	
	First person Vs. Third person

		Depends what you're going into and what you're doing.
		
		Acceptable to do either. 

	First:
		Maybe a little more approachable
		Ryan would use first person today 
		

	Third:
		Distance between you and reader
		advantage to third person
		If a journalist ever needs a bi-line from you then they can just 
		take it from your existing bio. 
			 


Why is there not a lot of information in RYANS BIO?
	
	Give the person enough information so they want to learn a little bit more
	He wanted to conserve space. 
	Figure what you want to leave in/out depending on the story that you want to tell.
	


Suggestions to make it better:


	Update it. 

	Get rid of run-on sentences. 

	Having a speaking style of writing. 

	American or Canadian spelling

	Change the spelling based on location?

	Spice it up. make it more entertaining

	adding an element of personality to it. 
		
	Make it more purpose driven 

	You can have fun with it. 

Conventions and stuff

	using geographical locations i.e. CASA in Lethbridge Alberta
