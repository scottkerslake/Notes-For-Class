Bio and Artist Statement planning phase.


Who Am I really?
	What do I want from life?

		I think it has to be some sort of creation, or creative focus.
		
		Hmmm. 
		
	What do I want to avoid?/ What is my rock bottom?

		I would say being jobless and friendless.
		
		A career that I absolutely despise.

		Living in a comfortable bliss all of the time is pretty nice, but is that the real world?
		
		
			


	What do I want to focus on in my career?

		Is it music? Coding? Entertainment?

What things separate me from the rest of the crowd? And why include them?

--I make music and other sounds in my spare time.
	What does this really show about me?

--I have participated in many choirs and other musical things including opera productions.
	Shows I can work with people.
	Come together to make something bigger than myself. 

Make crazy videos?
